We used single task as structure.
This task installs the LAMP stack on the servers given in the host file and runs the services. ansile-playbook lamp.yaml command can be used to run the script. 
If you want to use a file other than the default host file (/etc/ansible/hosts) you need to specify it with the -i parameter. ansible-playbook -i <your-host-file-path> lamp.yaml.
